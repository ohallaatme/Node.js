Q: Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.


A:


	- sort - sort returns the file sorted alphabetically by line. The output of 	running this on commands.js was the code returned but sorted alphabetically by line.

	- wc - wc prints the line, word, and byte counts for a file. When I ran this on commands.js it returns that I have 42 lines, 115 words and my file has a byte count of 1069
