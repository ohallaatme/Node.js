Questions

1.

Q: What is the difference between readdirSync and readdir?

A: readdirSync is a synchronous blocking function whereas readdir is an asynchronous non-blocking function meaning that we can execute tasks in the background and a call back will be executed once it is complete to let the rest of the program know.

2.

Q: What is the event loop and how does it handle asynchronous requests?

A: The event loop is what allows Javascript to have threading, callbacks and promises. It allows us to run slower programs in the background while we process other tasks. It handles asynchronous requests by running them and then processing the data once the callback function is executed and the ask is complete.
